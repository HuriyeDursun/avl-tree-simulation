# AVL Tree Simulation (Python & Tkinter)

This project is an **interactive AVL Tree simulation** developed using **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
It visually demonstrates how an AVL Tree maintains balance through rotations during **insertion** and **deletion** operations.

The application is designed for **educational purposes**, helping students understand:
- Self-balancing binary search trees
- AVL rotations (LL, LR, RR, RL)
- Tree traversals
- Height and balance factor concepts

---

## ✨ Features

- Insert values into an AVL Tree
- Delete values from the tree
- Search for a specific value
- Automatic AVL rebalancing with visual rotation feedback
- Visual representation of:
  - Nodes
  - Edges
  - Height (H)
  - Balance Factor (BF)
- Tree traversals:
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
- Sample tree generation
- Clear tree functionality
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (GUI library)

No external libraries are required.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HuriyeDursun/avl-tree-simulation.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd avl-tree-simulation
   ```
4. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python avl_tree_simulation.py
   ``` 

## 🎮 How to Use

- Enter an integer value in the input box.

- Use the buttons to:
  - **Insert**: Add a value to the AVL Tree  
  - **Delete**: Remove a value from the tree  
  - **Search**: Find a value and see its height and balance factor  

- Use traversal buttons to display:
  - Inorder  
  - Preorder  
  - Postorder  

- Click **Sample Tree** to automatically generate a predefined AVL Tree.

- Click **Clear** to reset the tree.

Rotation messages will be displayed automatically when rebalancing occurs.

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This project is suitable for:

- Data Structures & Algorithms courses  
- Understanding AVL Trees visually  
- Demonstrating tree balancing and rotations  
- Classroom demonstrations or self-study

## 📌 Notes
- Duplicate values are not allowed.
- All rotations are handled automatically.
- The tree always maintains AVL balance properties.
